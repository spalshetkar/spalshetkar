### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm full-time Software Engineer with 3+ years of experience, also a part-time Volunteer, and a Chess Enthusiast with a passion to work with people to create products to advance and solve real-life problems and improve society. 

I've experience in B2C and, FinTech, E-Commerce industries as a Backend Engineer with proficiency in building Spring Boot microservices while also having experience deploying to AWS using CI-CD pipelines. I look forward to working in product-based tech industries where I can provide value, learn from the organization and contribute to the community.
